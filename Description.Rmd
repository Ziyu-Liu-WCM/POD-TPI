## Introduction

We have proposed the PoD-TPI design to accelerate phase I trials and have developed a statistical methodology to calculate the posterior distribution of a dose assignment decision in the presence of pending toxicity outcomes. The posterior distribution directly reflects the confidence of all possible decisions, and the optimal decision is computed under a decision-theoretic framework. The PoD-TPI design is built upon the mTPI-2 design. Nevertheless, the proposed strategy can be applied to other model-free or model-assisted designs such as 3+3, BOIN, keyboard or i3+3.


## User-provided inputs

In dev


## Output
Dose decision will be decided from four possible choices(Suspend, De-escalation, Stay, Escalation). The recommended dose assignment for the current patient will also be given.
